In shocking surprise to nobody, streamer and alleged programmer 'thePrimeagen', famous for never completing a sideproject, has now announced he's taking game development 'seriously.' 

![7days](7days.jpg)

[thePrimeagen](https://x.com/theoprimeagen), known more for his Vim rants and eternal "WIP" side projects than for anything remotely resembling a finished product, now claims he's diving headfirst into a tower defense game (from inside a tower!?). 

Allegedly "vibe coded" in Lua, using the LÖVE2D framework, and “inspired by Balatro” — a description so vague it might as well mean “cards and vibes” — the project has admittedly passed the "screenshot of a black screen with a print statement" phase.


The irony? Game development holds the record for highest abandonment rate among programming fields, which makes the move seem less like ambition and more like professional self-parody. In an industry where even seasoned devs struggle to push games across the finish line, thePrimeagen’s involvement feels like a death sentence before the first commit.

“Of course I’m going to finish it,” he said on stream, while opening a 400th nvim split and getting distracted by Copilot's autocomplete. 

Sources close to the project — i.e., chatters throwing "KEKW" emojis — speculate the project’s real game loop is just the cycle of hype, burnout, and pivoting to the next obsession. "It’s [not] a game [....] it’s [performance] art," one viewer commented.

Critics are already placing bets on what will come first: an actually playable build, or the inevitable video essay titled “Why Game Dev Burned Me Out.”

Until then, the tower defense genre can sleep soundly knowing it's safe from innovation — at least from this direction.
