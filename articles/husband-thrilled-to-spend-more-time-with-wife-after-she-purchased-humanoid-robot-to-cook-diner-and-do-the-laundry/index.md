**Pasadena, CA -** As an anniversary present, Sonny Asimov's wife, Nina, surprised him with a new Tesla Optimus to help out around the house, cook dinner, and do the dishes and the laundry.

"It's great, now she watches the game with me instead of making dinner; I don’t know how I ever enjoyed watching sports without explaining the rules to someone every time," Sonny told us. "Oh, and now that laundry is handled by Optimus, she's been able to join me and the boys for Counter Strike night—it's great!"

"When we're not working, we're spending every moment together; it's almost like we're dating again," Nina told us. "Optimus is such a help; the kitchen is spotless! He even puts the dishes in the dishwasher and closes the cabinet doors!" she exclaimed.

In this exciting new era of robotics, it's heartwarming to see it’s allowing couples to spend much, much more quality time together.
