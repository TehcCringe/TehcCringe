For his thirtieth birthday, [Theo](https://x.com/theo) surprised [his haters](https://x.com/HSVSphere) with a new look by decapitating his Mustache and dying his hair brown.

Some suspect that his actions were influenced by a11y experts who claimed that the contrast of his face was not accessible to the visually impaired.

To prevent his paying customers from churning, Theo eventually decided to paywall his original face and introduced it as a paid feature in T3 Chat.
