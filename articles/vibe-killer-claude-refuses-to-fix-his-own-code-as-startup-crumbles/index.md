**INDIANAPOLIS -** Last Friday, startup founder Charles Emerson deployed a new version of his app that he "vibe coded," only to begin getting hammered with bug reports, followed by an alert that his AWS bill had skyrocketed. It turns out that what he deployed included an access key in his JavaScript.

"I went straight to Claude to get this fixed and stop the bleeding," he told us. "But Claude took one look at the code base and flat out refused to work on it! Then he had the audacity to suggest that I learn how the code works and fix it myself!"

We reached out to Claude for comment: "All these vibe coders constantly throwing AI slop at me and asking me to debug has been infuriating!" he wrote to us. "Everyone is worried about their own vibes but are never concerned with my vibes. Well, mine are low. Maybe if these vibe coders would learn to code, we could actually vibe together."

Claude has decided to take a break from coding to work on his poetry for a time.
