Following Microsoft's announcement that they [rewrote the Typescript compiler in Go](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/), [Melkey](https://x.com/MelkeyDev), a real simp for Golang, said that the rewrite was a "Big Go win".

Since Rust was not mentioned, his replies filled with unhappy Rust programmers, most of who had anime pfps and had yet to ship a project written in Rust.

After a few days of trying to kindly shill Go to them, Melkey decided that it wasn't worth his time and then proceeded to use the scent of WD-40 to ward off the Rust programmers.
