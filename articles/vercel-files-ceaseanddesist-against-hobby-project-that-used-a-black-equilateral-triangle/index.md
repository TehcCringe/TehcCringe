An anonymous builder tweeted a leaked email from Vercel claiming that his (unfinished) hobby project violated their trademark.

In horror, the builder complained that he had already purchased a domain name for the project and didn't want to cease development on it.

Following the leak, an outrage against Vercel's draconian trademark policies broke out on multiple social media platforms including [X](https://x.com), [Twitter](https://x.com), and [LinkedIn](https://4chan.org).

It is believed that the outrage was sparked when [ThePrimeagen](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen) told Vercel to ["ligma balls"](https://x.com/ThePrimeagen/status/1578608154744455168)

It would turn out that the builder had forgotten to remove the default favicon that came with Next.js
