It turns out ThePrimeagen’s greatest hot take wasn’t about neovim btw or brazil, brazil mentioned, it was perched under his nose. Literally. The internet’s favorite high-energy streamer, known for breaking down developer debates with the enthusiasm of a startup founder pitching a product no one asked for, has been exposed for wearing a fake mustache. Yes, that signature 'stache, once thought to embody wisdom and unshakable coding prowess, was nothing more than a stick-on accessory. A tragic day for facial hair enthusiasts and devs everywhere.

But should we really be surprised? This is the same guy who claimed, with a straight face, that “TypeScript is for cowards” and then immediately followed up with a two-hour stream about how strict types are the only way to prevent spaghetti code. The mustache was always the perfect metaphor: bold, assertive, a little over-the-top—but ultimately, a façade. Maybe the next hot take will involve "revolutionizing beard culture" by shaving with only Vim key bindings.

As ThePrimeagen scrambles to address this hairy controversy, one can’t help but wonder: was it all part of a long-term bit? Or is this the result of spending too much time in front of a camera and not enough in front of a mirror? Either way, we’re bracing ourselves for the inevitable follow-up video: "How to Handle Mustachegate While Staying Agile", complete with a monologue about how real developers embrace their flaws, fake or otherwise.
